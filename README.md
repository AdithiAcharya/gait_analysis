# Gait Analysis using opencv-python 3.4

Gait analysis is analysing an individual by their walking pattern and turns out to be a reliable indentification source.
As it turns out, it is as reliable and unique as one's fingerprint and retina scan.

Following code explore the possibility to do the same by invovling following steps:
- Capturing image sequence
- Background modeling and Image subtraction
- Extracting binary silouette image
- Performing image correlation
- Applying discrete Fourier transformation
- Normalise results
- Perform primary component analysis
- Taking distance correction into account
- Indentification and verification
